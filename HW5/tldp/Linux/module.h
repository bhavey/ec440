 * The following other idents are available
 *
 *	"Proprietary"			[Non free products]
 *
 * There are dual licensed components, but when running with Linux it is the
 * GPL that is relevant so this is a non issue. Similarly LGPL linked with GPL
 * is a GPL combined work.
 *
 * This exists for several reasons
 * 1.	So modinfo can show license info for users wanting to vet their setup 
 *	is free
 * 2.	So the community can ignore bug reports including proprietary modules
 * 3.	So vendors can do likewise based on their own policies
