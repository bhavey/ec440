This homework is an extension/elaboration of the previous server problem. This week, you
  will build a multithreaded server using pthreads and a client to go with it.

 *Each client should connect and send some number of lines each of which contains a positive
   integer, terminated by a blank line.
 *The server should create a thread when the client connects and that thread should sum up
   all the integers sent by the client and send the sum to the client.
 *In addition, the server should send each client a second line that reads: "The current
   Grand Total is XXXXX and I have served YYYYY clients so far!",where the number
   XXXXX is the sum of the totals for ALL clients served and YYYYY is the total number
   of client requests.
            
NOTE: computing the grand total and client total requires using shared memory among the threads
AND synchronization to avoid errors.
